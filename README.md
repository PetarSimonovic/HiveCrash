This game is currently in development. An early build is available to preview on Unity Play:

## How to play

Your hive starts with five bees and is full of pollen

Bees in flight/total bees and pollen percentage are displayed above it.

Click, drag back and release to launch a bee from the hive.

Ping bees off rocks to explore the map. 

But be careful: once you disturb a rival hive its bees will try to steal your pollen.

Collect pollen from flowers that are in bloom or steal pollen from your rival to replenish the health of your hive.

Bees are vulnerable while collecting pollen from a flower. Knock your rivals onto a flower then hit them for a fatal attack.

The more pollen a hive has, the heavier it is. Light hives are easy for even the smallest bee to move.

Destroy all of your rival's bees or take its pollen then then push it into water to defeat it, before its bees push you over the edge.

## How to win

Defeat the enemy hive and explore the entire map.
