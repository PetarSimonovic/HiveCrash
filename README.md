The game currently runs in Unity's mobile simulator and can be built for iOS.

## How to play

Pull back and release to launch a bee from the hive.

Collect pollen from flowers: bees need to eat pollen to survive.

Explore the map. 

If you discover an enemy hive, ping bees at it to attach. Bees that hit a hive will steal pollen from it and nudge it.

Push the rival hive off the map or into a lake to defeat it.
