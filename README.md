The game is an early build. It currently runs in Unity's mobile simulator and can be built for iOS.

## How to play

Your hive is home to five bees.

Click, drag back and release to launch a bee from the hive.

Ping bees off rocks to rxplore the map. 

But be careful: once you disturb a rival hive its bees will try to steal your pollen.

Collect pollen from flowers that are in bloom or steal pollen from your rival to replenish the health of your hive.

Bees are vulnerable while collecting pollen from a flower. Knock your rivals onto a flower then hit them for a fatal attack.

The more pollen a hive has, the heavier it is. Light hives are easy for even the smallest bee to move.

Take all of your rival's pollen then then push it into water to defeat it, before its bees push you over the edge.

## How to win

Defeat the enemy hive and explore the entire map.
