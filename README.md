The game is an early build. It currently runs in Unity's mobile simulator and can be built for iOS.

## How to play

Click, drag back and release to launch a bee from the hive.

Explore the map.

Collect pollen from flowers that are in bloom: bees need to eat pollen to survive.

Ping bees at enemy hives to attack. 

Bees that hit a hive will steal pollen from it and return the spoils to their home.

The more pollen a hive has, the heavier it is. Light hives are easy for even the smallest bee to move.

Nudge the rival hive off the map or into a lake to defeat it, before its bees push you over the edge.
